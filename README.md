# Simple Interest Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates Simple Interest based on user input.

## Description
The program takes the Principal amount, Rate of interest, and Time period as inputs and outputs the calculated Simple Interest and the Total Amount.

## The Formula
The calculation is based on the standard mathematical formula:

$$SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}$$

Where:
* **P** = Principal Amount
* **R** = Rate of Interest per annum
* **T** = Time in years

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

   Enter Principal Amount: 1000
Enter Rate of Interest (%): 5
Enter Time Period (years): 2

Simple Interest: 100.0
Total Amount: 1100.0
