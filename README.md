This is a simple Python program that calculates Simple Interest based on user input.

## Description
The program takes the Principal amount, Rate of interest, and Time period as inputs and outputs the calculated Simple Interest and the Total Amount.

## The Formula
The calculation is based on the standard mathematical formula:

$$SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}$$

Where:
* **P** = Principal Amount
* **R** = Rate of Interest per annum
* **T** = Time in years

## How to Run
